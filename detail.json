    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that aims to function as a means of exchange that is independent of any central authority. BTC can be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable, and immutable way.\n\nLaunched in 2009, BTC is the first virtual currency to solve the double-spending issue by timestamping transactions before broadcasting them to all of the nodes in the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin Protocol offered a solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem with a blockchain network structure, a notion first created by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta in 1991.\n\nBitcoin’s whitepaper was published pseudonymously in 2008 by an individual, or a group, with the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto”, whose underlying identity has still not been verified.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol uses an SHA-256d-based Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm to reach network consensus. Its network has a target block time of 10 minutes and a maximum supply of 21 million tokens, with a decaying token emission rate. To prevent fluctuation of the block time, the network's block difficulty is re-adjusted through an algorithm based on the past 2016 block times.\n\nWith a block size limit capped at 1 megabyte, the Bitcoin Protocol has supported both the Lightning Network, a second-layer infrastructure for payment channels, and Segregated Witness, a soft-fork to increase the number of transactions on a block, as solutions to network scalability.",

    "description": "Ethereum was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer. The platform is based on the principle of decentralization, which means that it is not controlled by any single entity.\n\nEthereum allows users to build and deploy software, commonly in the form of DApps, which are then powered by a global distributed network of computers running Ethereum. The network is decentralized, making it highly resistant to any form of censorship or downtime.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum is an open-source blockchain platform that runs on the usage of its native currency, called Ether or ETH. All network transaction fees, or gas fees, are paid in ETH. ETH specifically used by the Ethereum blockchain to pay for transactions, and is responsible for powering just about everything that occurs on the network. \n\nThe Ethereum network can be used by anybody to create and run smart contracts, which are software programs that run autonomously, without user intervention. Ethereum’s growth can be attributed in part to its smart contract capability, which has enabled a growing ecosystem of DApps, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more. \n\nEthereum completed its switch from a PoW to a PoS consensus mechanism in September 2022. In a PoS consensus mechanism, users can stake 32 ETH to validate transactions rather than solving computational puzzles using mining equipment, making the process more energy-efficient.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade brought in a range of technical enhancements to the Ethereum platform. One of the key features introduced is the ability for users to access and unstake their Ethereum tokens that were previously locked in a smart contract as validators on the Beacon Chain.",

    "description": "General Data and Information\n\nThe Litecoin software was released on the 7th October 2011 by Charlie Lee, with the network going live roughly a week later on the 13th of October 2011. As a fork of Bitcoin Core, Litecoin featured several improvements upon the original Bitcoin protocol including reduced blocktimes (decreased to 2.5 minutes instead of 10 minutes), increased total supply and a different proof of work algorithm (scrypt vs SHA-256). \n\nThe adoption of a faster blocktime meant that transactions were quicker to settle and be written into the blockchain, whilst the adoption of the memory intensive scrypt algorithm was intended to defeat the ASIC dominance of mining (due to the added financial costs of producing specialized mining machines with the required extra memory). However, due to the popularity of Litecoin, ASICs have been already developed and deployed that are able to mine the scrypt algorithm.\n\nOften considered to be the silver to Bitcoin’s gold status, improvements and upgrades are often rolled out to the Litecoin network before they reach the Bitcoin network (such as the SegWit and Lightning Network upgrades). This practice has also led to some people derisively calling Litecoin the test-network for Bitcoin. \n\nMilestones\n\n7th October 2011 - Open Source software for Litecoin released. \n13th October 2011 - Litecoin network goes live. \nMay 2017 - Segregated Witness (SegWit) implemented. First Lightning Network transaction completed on the Litecoin network. \n\n\nUtility\n\nLitecoin serves a similar use-case function as Bitcoin, attempting to be a digital store of value and medium of exchange but with the advantage of faster block times (which makes transactions faster to settle). In addition (due to lower network usage), it has lower transaction fees than the better known flagship crypto-currency. However, it suffers from a smaller market capitalization and liquidity which makes it much less useful as a pairing partner for other crypto-currencies. \n\nSignificant Features\n\n- Average Blocktime of 2.5 minutes; Total supply of 84 million LTC; Proof of Work consensus based on scrypt algorithm. \n- Transactions are pseduo-anonymous. Funds are sent address to address, but an owner identity can eventually attributed to an address given enough data and analysis.\n- Whilst sharing many decentralized attributes of consensus and governance as Bitcoin, Litecoin does have a known creator who can provide vision and guidance for the direction of the project. \n- Decentralized access allowing any party with the open-source software and internet access to send and receive Litecoin irreversibly without third party interference or trust. \n- Decentralized governance via open-source development and forking.",

Their white paper was released ahead of their August 2017 ICO on the Ethereum blockchain. Featuring a high TPS (Transactions per second), the network enables creators to publish, store and retain ownership of their content, allowing content creators to be directly rewarded by content consumers via the native coin (TRX) and other crypto-currencies. \n\nUsing a network decentralized (peer to peer) file storage systems, the Sun network allows content to be placed on the blockchain without the requirement of content publishing middlemen (publishing platforms). The types of entertainment content can range from the familiar forms of music and video through to the newer forms of decentralized applications (dApps) such as online gaming and gambling.\n\nMilestones\nApril 2017 - Tron Foundation established. \nAugust 2017 - Tron ICO\n31st May 2018 - Tron Mainnet launched.\nJune 2018 - ERC20 tokens migrated to to Tron.\n23rd July 2018 - Bittorrent acquired by Tron\n\nUtility\nThe native coin (TRX) can be used by content consumers to pay creators for in-game assets, or use as currency in gaming or to reward creators directly for their entertainment content or to purchase additional access. In turn, the coin can be used by content creators to pay for various services on the network. \nFreezing (staking) TRX tokens results in energy and bandwidth required to interact smoothly with the network as well as the increase in voting power of voting for Super Representatives. \n\nSignificant Features\nAverage blocktime of 15 seconds; Total supply of 100 billion TRX; Consensus via Proof of Stake (Fast Paxos). \nHigh bandwidth, averaging 2000 Transactions per Second. \nLimited TRX price contorl via centralized burn or minting. \nScalability design from inception.",

It provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. Ethereum Classic also provides a value token called \"classic ether\", which can be transferred between participants, stored in a cryptocurrency wallet and is used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed. The classic ether token is traded on cryptocurrency exchanges under the ticker symbol ETC. Gas, an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to prevent spam on the network and allocate resources proportionally to the incentive offered by the request.\n\nThe Ethereum platform has been forked into two versions: \"Ethereum Classic\" (ETC) and \"Ethereum\" (ETH). Prior to the fork, the token had been called Ethereum. After the fork, the new tokens kept the name Ethereum (ETH), and the old tokens were renamed Ethereum Classic (ETC). Ethereum Classic appeared as a result of a disagreement with the Ethereum Foundation regarding The DAO Hard Fork. It united members of the Ethereum community who rejected the hard fork on philosophical grounds. Users that owned ETH before the DAO hard fork (block 1920000) own an equal amount of ETC after the fork.\n\nEthereum Classic passed a technical hard fork to adjust the internal prices for various opcodes of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on October 25, 2016, similar to the hard fork committed by Ethereum a week previously. The purpose of the hard fork was a more rational distribution of payments for resource-intensive calculations, which led to the elimination of the favorable conditions for attacks that were previously conducted on ETH and ETC. A hard fork held at the beginning of 2017 successfully delayed the \"bomb complexity\" that was added to the Ethereum code in September 2015 with a view of exponentially increasing the complexity of mining and the process of calculation of new network units. In late 2017, a hard fork occurred which changed the monetary policy with unlimited emissions to a system similar to Bitcoin.",

Founded in 2017 by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis, Chainlink aims to solve the problem of off-chain information sourcing by smart contracts for their execution parameters. Smart contracts are designed to execute automatically when certain paramenters are met, however, when these parameters exist off-chain there is a reliance on sources of information (known as oracles) to provide the necessary information. Off-chain oracles tend to be centralized and with it comes a reliance on a third party to provide critical information in a trustworthy and time critical manner. ChainLink aims to break this reliance by feeding information to smart contracts via a network of decentralized oracles that work together on the Link blockchain to verify and forward critical information to these contracts.  The ChainLink network allows users who have either a data feed or information carrying APIs to easily provide information to smart-contracts in exchange for the LINK token. \n\nMilestones\nSeptember 2017 - ChainLink ICO.\nNovember 2018 - Town Crier (smart contracts and data privacy projects) acquired. \n13th June 2019 - Partnership with Google announced\n\nUtility\nThe Link Network provides timely and accurate information to smart contracts via a decentralized network of oracles (data feeds and APIs). This information is critical to the effective and accurate execution of smart contracts, as the information required exists off-chain and a reliable method for getting the information on chain is necessary. The LINK token serves as a payment for smart contracts that utilise the data provided by the Link Network, with oracles that provide accurate information being rewarded in proportion to their staked LINK. \n\nSignificant Features\nPartnerships with major industry players such as SWIFT and Google\nIntegrations by Ethereum sidechains such as Harmony, Celer and Matic.\nAverage blocktime n/a; Total supply of 1 Billion LINK ; Oracle Consensus written into Ethereum Blockchain via threshold signatures.",

In order to have a self-regulating ecosystem hosting distributed applications, we need an accounting method that improves efficiency as it scales so we can reward hosts in the sharing economy of the ecosystem which is created by inviting all stakeholders to participate in the system through our ICO (Initial Community Offering) which provides the right to purchase hosting services.\n\nThe Holo ecosystem relies on hosts that provide processing and storage for distributed applications while earning redeemable credits.",

    "description": "Theta Fuel — The operational token of the Theta Network\n\nAs we get close to the Theta mainnet launch on March 15th, 2019, we are re-branding one the most important parts of the Theta protocol — the operational token, which will be known as Theta Fuel (TFUEL). Theta Fuel is a 2nd token in the Theta protocol that works in conjunction with the Theta Token (THETA) that exists today.\n\nIf you’ve been following the Theta project, this is the same operational token we’ve been discussing since June, but will be renamed from “Gamma” to “Theta Fuel”. There a few key reasons for this:\n\nWe wanted a name that users will intuitively understand the token’s function . Theta Fuel is exactly what it sounds like — the fuel of the Theta Network! Theta Fuel powers the network by incentivizing users to share content with each other, and will be burned as users deploy and interact with smart contracts.\nFeedback from our partners like MBN and CJ was that users were confused by the introduction of a seemingly unrelated token called Gamma. Theta Fuel builds on the Theta brand rather than distracting from it. Since our partners have significant user bases of their own, their feedback on user behavior is invaluable for maximizing usage/adoption of the Theta protocol.\nIf you’re just learning about the Theta Network, here are some FAQs on Theta Fuel and how it fits in to the Theta Network:\n\nWhat’s the difference between the Theta Token and Theta Fuel?\n\n\nTheta Token (THETA): The governance token of the Theta protocol. THETA is used to stake as a Validator or Guardian node, contributing to block production and the protocol governance of the Theta Network. By staking and running a node, users will earn a proportional amount of the new TFUEL generated. The supply of THETA is fixed at 1 billion and will never increase. THETA currently exists as an ERC20 token and is traded on major exchanges. At Mainnet launch on March 15th, ERC20 THETA will be replaced by new THETA tokens on the Theta blockchain at a 1:1 ratio.\n\n\nTheta Fuel (TFUEL): The operational token of the Theta protocol. TFUEL powers on-chain operations like payments to relayers for sharing a video stream, or for deploying or interacting with smart contracts. Relayers earn TFUEL for every video stream they relay to other users on the network. You can think of Theta Fuel as the “gas” of the protocol. At Mainnet launch on March 15th, TFUEL will be created as a native token on the Theta blockchain.\n\nHow will Theta Fuel be generated? At what rate?\n\nThe genesis distribution of Theta Fuel will happen when then Theta mainnet launches on March 15th. For each THETA that you hold when the Theta Mainnet launches, you will also receive 5 TFUEL to seed the ecosystem. To ensure you receive this initial distribution, make sure to follow our mainnet token swap procedures.\n\nAfter the initial distribution of 5 billion TFUEL (5 for each of the 1 billion THETA), the supply will increase at an initial annual target rate of 5%. The new supply rate will be determined at the protocol level, and can be adjusted as needed by protocol consensus to provide the appropriate amount of new supply as demanded by platforms on the Theta Network. Each network participant running a Validator or Guardian node will earn part of that new supply of TFUEL, proportional to the amount of THETA they are staking.\n\nWill each viewer need to pay TFUEL to pull video streams on the Theta Network?\n\nTechnically that’s true at the protocol level, but the actual model implemented on SLIVER.tv, and our initial partners like MBN and Samsung VR, is that the cost of TFUEL falls on the video platform. Platforms subsidize users with the TFUEL necessary to pull video streams from relayers on the Theta Network. This makes sense, because video platforms are the ones most directly gaining from getting more viewers to pull their video stream from the Theta Network, in the form of lower CDN costs and higher user engagement. We think it’s critical that the end-user never has to go out and purchase any TFUEL tokens just to watch videos on the Theta Network — it’s just too much of a friction point for adoption.\n\nWhy introduce a second currency at all?\n\nThere are two key reasons to introduce a second token:\n\nFirst, this allows the utility and purpose of each token to be separated. THETA is used strictly for staking and securing the network, while TFUEL is used to power microtransactions and operations of the network. This is necessary because staking inherently decreases circulating supply, but video relay transactions and smart contracts will require a highly-liquid token that can facilitate millions of daily transactions.\nSecond, two tokens are needed to solve governance issues that arise from using the same token for staking and operations. Because the token used for operations must be liquid, it would be easier for a malicious actor to accumulate a significant number of that frequently-traded token on the open market. If that same token is also used for staking, they could potentially threaten the security of the Theta Network by quietly acquiring a large amount of the staking token. By separating the two functions (staking and operations) into different tokens, that risk is greatly decreased.",

Co-founders, Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, two software engineers by professional background and experience, wanted to make cryptocurrency accessible to individuals outside of Bitcoin.\n\nIt was expressed by the founders that the oversaturation and difficulty in mining Bitcoin from the time of its creation to the start of Dogecoin, made it difficult for the common person to participate in the mining process. This was because of limited resources as well as technological experience. Dogecoin was envisioned as an entry for the less experienced to become involved in the crypto industry.\n\nThe launch of Bitcoin in 2009 catalyzed the creation and launch of many different cryptocurrencies, each offering different use cases and functionality. Dogecoin, however, offers no specific use cases — DOGE was a collaborative effort by the crypto community and is now listed on most major exchange platforms.\n\nDogecoin was originally based on Litecoin and was launched in 2013. Primarily designed to provide a light-hearted means of communicating the basic function of cryptocurrency to mainstream audiences, Dogecoin is based on the “Doge” Shiba Inu meme.

Contentos also intends to establish itself as the future Ethereum of digital content, accepting content DApps of all kinds.\n\nSocial media offers the opportunity for every user to have a platform dedicated to the promotion of their individual visions of the world at large. The current content ecosystem is run by centralized platforms that depend on advertising for revenue. Content creators are, therefore, pressured to produce content that is approved by advertisers instead of following their creative muses and expressing themselves freely. The constraints inherent to ad-driven content platforms begs the question of just how much freedom of expression is actually allowable. Are these individual influencer world views being traded in for carefully-crafted sponsored content for the masses? Furthermore, when looking at the bottom line, it’s imperative to ask the question, where is the majority of the money going? In the current content system, corporate platforms reap the lion’s share of rewards generated by ad dollars, leaving mere pennies to the influencers whose content the platforms depend on. These tech giants tempt content creators with promises of viable income while exploiting their creations for their own gain. In this model, creators and users lose while the tech platforms flourish at their expense.\n\nAt Contentos, we believe all members of the content ecosystem should benefit from their contributions. By utilizing the tokenization enabled by blockchain technology, Contentos aims to bring to life the dream of a more fair and democratic content environment. Content creation, curation, distribution, storage, and verification are all rewarded in COS tokens, the unique cryptocurrency powering the Contentos ecosystem.",

It is a system similar to bitcoin but with a user-friendly interface and front-end that is similar to Venmo, Square or PayPal. Metal can act as a bridge to bitcoin or any cryptocurrency available. Many small businesses across the world prefer to only accept cash. However, in an increasingly cashless society, refusing to accept digital and card payments can be problematic. Put simply, Metal believes cash only businesses can benefit by adopting cryptocurrency as a new new form of cash, as cryptocurrencies possess many of the same properties particularly around privacy, censorship resistance and fungibility. In order to bring digital payments into a world that utilizes blockchain-based technology over some traditional banking rails, Metal expects to save consumers 4-5% on all purchases",

Further changes to the Bitcoin protocol include a reduced blocktime of one minute, block rewards of 5000 RVN and, most notably, the added functionality to issue assets and sub-assets.\n\nToken issuers have flexibility to issue tokens with various characteristics. For instance, these tokens can be mintable, named without restriction, and issued in any quantity. Tokens can also be issued as a security or as a collectible.\n\nIt is intended that use cases such as communication or voting will similarly rely on purpose-built tokens that are subsequently allocated to relevant addresses and are acting as \"talking sticks\".\n\nRVN coins are intended as internal currency within the network and must be burnt in order to issue token assets on the Ravenchain.",

It is similar to bitcoin with regards to its protocol; Proof of Work SHA-256 hashing, 21,000,000 supply, same block times and reward system. However, two main differences are the block size limits, as of August 2017 Bitcoin has a 1MB block size limit whereas (BCC)/BCH  proposes 8MB blocks. Also, (BCC)/BCH  will adjust the difficulty every 6 blocks as opposed to 2016 blocks as with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Cash is a proposal from the via BTC mining pool and the Bitmain mining group to carry out a UAHF (User Activated Hard Fork) on August 1st 12:20 pm UTC. They rejected the agreed consensus (aka BIP-91 or SegWit2x) and have decided to fork the original Bitcoin blockchain and create this new version called “Bitcoin Cash”. Bitcoin Cash can be claimed by BTC owners who have their private keys or store their Bitcoins on a service that will split (BCC)/BCH  for the customer.",

Users can conveniently issue, store and exchange their digital assets in Vite system.\n                   \nIn the future, Vite’s mobile app will come with an HTML5 engine for creating dApplets (Decentralized Applets).  Smart contracts on the Vite platform and corresponding SDK support will make it easy to develop and deploy dApps on Vite.",

Loopring 3.0 can settle up to 1,400 trades per second while guaranteeing the same level of security as the underlying Ethereum blockchain. This is made possible by using a construction called zkRollup, and a feature called On-Chain Data Availability, or OCDA. If OCDA is disabled, Loopring throughput becomes as high as 10,500 trades per second, but security reduces to that of the consortium which maintains said data.\n\nThe average settlement cost for each trade with Loopring 3.0 is as low as $0.002 USD, which covers the gas for Ethereum transactions and the cost of proof generation on cloud computing platforms. DEXes can further lower the settlement cost by using cheaper servers in the cloud and GPU-based algorithms. To put things in perspective, most brokers' stock trading fees in the US are in the range of $2 to $7 USD per trade.",

Land in Decentraland is permanently owned by the community, giving them full control over their creations. Users claim ownership of virtual land on a blockchain-based ledger of parcels. Landowners control what content is published to their portion of land, which is identified by a set of cartesian coordinates (x,y). Contents can range from static 3D scenes to interactive systems such as games.\n\nLand is a non-fungible, transferrable, scarce digital asset stored in an Ethereum smart contract. It can be acquired by spending an ERC20 token called MANA. MANA can also be used to make in-world purchases of digital goods and services.\n\nPeople are spending increasingly more time in virtual worlds, for both leisure and work. This occurs predominantly in 2D interfaces such as the web and mobile phones. But a traversable 3D world adds an immersive component as well as adjacency to other content, enabling physical clusters of communities.\n\nUnlike other virtual worlds and social networks, Decentraland is not controlled by a centralized organization. There is no single agent with the power to modify the rules of the so ware, contents of land, economics of the currency, or prevent others from accessing the world.",

Consistently recognized as one of the world’s most innovative blockchain projects, Komodo is developing technologies at the cutting-edge of the blockchain industry. In reality, most blockchain platforms today are but a single blockchain that offers support for smart contracts and decentralized applications. This model forces all projects to share the same infrastructure, leading to congestion, increased transactions fees, and stifled growth. Whereas other blockchain platforms employ a single, shared-blockchain model, Komodo’s federated multi-chain architecture provides each and every external project with independent infrastructure and a dedicated blockchain. \n\nThis multi-chain design is what makes Komodo unique among blockchain platforms. Each project is given the opportunity to create their own blockchain ecosystem via Komodo’s infinitely scalable infrastructure. \n\nKomodo’s tech enables seamless cross-chain interoperability among all federated blockchains. Every blockchain built with Komodo is also connected to 95% of chains outside the federation via atomic swap technology. Future plans are in place for blockchain bridging support, which will create cross-chain fungibility throughout the entire blockchains industry. Moreover, with Komodo’s architecture, multiple blockchains can sync up and function as a single chain. \n\nIf one chain is not meeting performance needs, additional chains can be added to form a blockchain cluster. A blockchain cluster boosts performance linearly without inflating coin supply or devaluing the currency. The Komodo ecosystem is not only scalable and interoperable, it’s also secured with the power of the Bitcoin network. This is accomplished with a series of cross-chain notarizations that store a blockhash onto the Bitcoin ledger every ten minutes, providing protection from 51% attacks. Join Komodo as we continue to accelerate the global adoption of blockchain technology.",

The current use cases for EGLD include:\n\nNetwork transactions: EGLD is paid by users for transaction fees for interacting with dApps, smart contracts, web3 payments and NFTs.\n\nStaking: Users can run validator nodes and stake EGLD to secure the network. Alternatively, users can also stake their EGLD to non-custodial staking services providers.\n\nGovernance: participate in on-chain governance and vote on various improvement proposals.\n\nThe project consists of the following major components working in conjunction:\n\nAdaptive State Sharding: works via shard merges & splits for unlimited scalability and uses a fully sharded Architecture, which includes state, transactions, and network. This architecture is deemed highly resilient against malicious attacks due to validators shuffling between shards.\n\nSmart-contract royalties: 30% of the fees are reallocated to the smart contract author.\n\nSecure Proof of Stake: eliminates PoW computational waste, and combines eligibility through stake and rating with random validator selection, and an optimal dimension for the consensus group.\n\nAs of Jan 17th 2023, the maximum token supply of EGLD is 31,415,926. The current circulating supply is 24,184,559 (~77% of the total max supply).\n\nCustom tokens on MultiversX operate natively, being as fast, scalable and inexpensive as EGLD. Moreover, their creation and management don’t imply the Virtual Machine (Smart Contracts) at all, which mitigates ‘hidden’ security risks when transferring tokens.",

At the beginning, Firo was the first cryptocurrency implementing the Zerocoin protocol designed by Matthew Green in 2013.\n\nFiro is based on Bitcoin's source-code, with a GPU-friendly ASIC-resistant algorithm (Merkle Tree Function since 2018). Its total maximum supply is 21.4 million and block rewards are halved every four years.\n\nFiro has activated its Lelantus privacy protocol on January 12 2021, which increases the anonymity set and hides change amounts while protecting transactional privacy without requiring a trusted setup. Lelantus is the result of Firo’s research team and its innovations are also being used in other privacy projects such as Beam (Lelantus-MW) and Monero (Triptych).",

With Verge Currency, businesses and individuals now have flexible options for sending and receiving payments.\n\nIs Verge Currency a private company and how is it funded?\n\nFollowing in the spirit of Bitcoin, Verge is an open-source software, and a community. It is not a company, never had an ICO, nor premine. The development is entirely funded by the community and the developers. \n\nWHY VERGE\n\nThe way that Bitcoin functions, has severe flaws with regards to privacy:\n\n- Public Ledger: The transaction information is public, meaning, that transactions can be linked to a person\n- IP Leakage: A persistent and motivated attacker will be able to associate your IP address with your Bitcoin transaction\n\nDue to the above mentioned reasons, it was clear that there would be a need for a privacy coin. Several coins with the similar idea have been created at the time but they were ‘too private’ in the sense that they completely by-passed the public ledger. The public ledger allows merchants to provide proof of transactions, which is important for bookkeeping.\n\nEnter Verge a currency which makes it possible to make private transactions, on a public ledger. Thereby giving every user, the level of privacy they choose.",

Rather than passive followers, Mina encourages users to actively engage with the blockchain.  The Mina Protocol employs zero-knowledge proofs to craft a more efficient blockchain architecture. Unlike earlier blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which accumulate data and grow to hundreds of gigabytes, Mina maintains a constant size of approximately 22KB. It verifies the current consensus state using a single, recursive 22KB zero-knowledge proof, enabling swift synchronization and validation for network participants.",

In fact, the Steem blockchain not only processes more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum combined, it actually processes more transactions then the next 11 blockchains (in order of transactions) combined!\n\nThe Steem blockchain creates opportunities for entrepreneurs by providing a scalable blockchain protocol which their application can tap into that is capable of storing a user’s content, social information, account information, json metadata, and more, while simultaneously empowering those users to earn cryptocurrency tokens (called STEEM) in exchange for sharing that information. The STEEM token features best-in-class properties like 3 second transfers and no fees thanks to Steem’s 3-second blocks and Delegated-Proof-of-Stake algorithm. \n\nWith the upcoming release of the Smart Media Tokens protocol (SMT), the community will be adding to the Steem blockchain the capability to allow an entrepreneur, developer or community builder to launch their own customizable STEEM-like tokens on top of the Steem blockchain equipped with specific smart contracts for ICOs, Automated Market Makers, Autonomous Token Distribution, Founders Tokens, and more. SMTs will take full advantage of the Steem blockchain’s speed and unparalleled scalability to enable entrepreneurs to monetize their platform and bootstrap the value of their coin by leveraging all the lessons learned from Steem and Steemit.com.",

So, as the Neo network grows and becomes more used and then the GAS produced by holding NEO will increase and increase.",

It can easily adapt to any blockchain innovations by customizing consensus, transaction model ( including VM), ledger and token economics in each shard so that to satisfy different requirements of different industries/enterprises/DApps. \n\nNow the network support two consensuses, PoW and PoSW ( a combination of PoS+ PoW), more consensuses (DPoS, PoS and etc)  will be added into different shards in the future. \n\nAnd it is EVM-compatible right now, every DApp deployed in eth will be easy to deploy in QuarkChain. Later on, we will add more virtual machines ( for example EOS VM ) in different shards, so that developers have more choices. \n\nScalability\nQuarkChain aims to deliver 100,000+ on-chain TPS. \nCurrently, 55000+ peak TPS has already been achieved in TPS competition held within the community\n\nDecentralization\nQuarkChain has a two-layered structure and encourages individual miners with different levels of capability to mine directly without joining mining pools. People can choose to mine either in the root chain or in the shard. \n\nUsability\nQuarkChain supports Native token which enables each shard to have their own token economic. It also supports scalable cross-shard transactions. There is only one account required to access entire resources in all shards, and smart wallets seamlessly simplify the management.",

UniLend runs a dual-asset pool model that enables users to supply and borrow against ERC20 tokens. Users can supply assets to earn interest, after which they can utilize those very assets to borrow other tokens. The protocol supports a variable interest rate model that changes depending on the dynamics between supply and demand. Furthermore, UniLend also allows for flash loans, where a user can take an uncollateralized loan if it's paid back in the very same transaction block.",

This stake can be slashed if a malicious behavior is detected.\n\nGovernance: ALT token holders can vote on governance decisions.\n\nProtocol Incentivization: Operators in the AltLayer ecosystem can earn ALT tokens as rewards for their services.\n\nProtocol Fees: Network participants will need to pay for intra-network services in ALT tokens.\n\nAltLayer’s core offering of restaked rollups consists of three key products: \n\nVITAL: An Actively Validated Service (AVS), where operators verify blocks and the corresponding states committed by the rollup sequencer and raise fraud proof challenges if necessary.\n\nMACH: A protocol to provide faster finality to rollups by allowing operators to restake Ethereum-based assets to back any claims on the rollup state.\n\nSQUAD: Offer decentralized sequencing with economic backing. Decentralized sequencing eliminates short-term liveness concerns, bad MEV, rent extractions and other issues associated with rollups that operate with a single sequencer.",

Solvers bid on the best possible exchange rate in order to win the right to settle trades. By batching multiple trades together in order to create CoWs (Coincidence of Wants), solvers can save on gas costs, AMM fees and execution risk. Therefore CoWs lead to structurally better prices than on any existing DEX aggregator. In the absence of CoWs solvers fall back to using the best possible on-chain route, by comparing quotes from leading aggregators.  COW token allows its holders the right to govern and curate the infrastructure of the CoW Protocol ecosystem through the CowDAO. Additionally, COW token holders receive fee discounts when trading on CowSwap & some other perks.",
